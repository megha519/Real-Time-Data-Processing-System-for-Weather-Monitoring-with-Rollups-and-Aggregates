# Real-Time-Data-Processing-System-for-Weather-Monitoring-with-Rollups-and-Aggregates
A real-time weather monitoring system that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API every 5 minutes. It computes daily summaries, including average, max, and min temperatures, along with the dominant weather condition. The system also implements alert thresholds for extreme weather and visualizes trends through plots.


## Objective
Develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system utilizes data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Data Source
The system continuously retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. You will need to sign up for a free API key to access the data. The API provides various weather parameters, and we will focus on:
- **main**: Main weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
- **temp**: Current temperature in Celsius
- **feels_like**: Perceived temperature in Celsius
- **dt**: Time of the data update (Unix timestamp)

## Processing and Analysis
- The system calls the OpenWeatherMap API at configurable intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve real-time weather data for major metros in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad).
- Each received weather update includes:
  - Conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (consider user preference).

## Rollups and Aggregates
1. **Daily Weather Summary**:
   - Roll up the weather data for each day.
   - Calculate daily aggregates:
     - Average temperature
     - Maximum temperature
     - Minimum temperature
     - Dominant weather condition (justification required)
   - Store daily summaries in a database or persistent storage for further analysis.

2. **Alerting Thresholds**:
   - Define user-configurable thresholds for temperature or specific weather conditions (e.g., alert if temperature exceeds 35Â°C for two consecutive updates).
   - Continuously track the latest weather data and compare it with the thresholds.
   - If a threshold is breached, trigger an alert for the current weather conditions (can be displayed on the console or through email notifications).

3. **Implement Visualizations**:
   - Visualize daily weather summaries, historical trends, and triggered alerts.

## Test Cases
1. **System Setup**:
   - Verify the system starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a valid API key.
   
2. **Data Retrieval**:
   - Simulate API calls at configurable intervals and ensure the system retrieves and parses weather data correctly.
   
3. **Temperature Conversion**:
   - Test conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit based on user preference).
   
4. **Daily Weather Summary**:
   - Simulate a sequence of weather updates over several days.
   - Verify that daily summaries are calculated correctly, including average, maximum, minimum temperatures, and the dominant weather condition.
   
5. **Alerting Thresholds**:
   - Define and configure user thresholds for temperature or weather conditions.
   - Simulate weather data exceeding thresholds and verify that alerts are triggered only when violations occur.

## Bonus Features
- Support additional weather parameters from the OpenWeatherMap API (e.g., humidity, wind speed) and incorporate them into rollups/aggregates.
- Implement functionalities to retrieve weather forecasts and generate summaries based on predicted conditions.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality and correctness of the real-time data processing system.
- Accuracy of data parsing, temperature conversion, and rollup/aggregate calculations.
- Efficiency of data retrieval and processing within acceptable intervals.
- Completeness of test cases covering various weather scenarios and user configurations.
- Clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
- (Bonus) Implementation of additional features.
